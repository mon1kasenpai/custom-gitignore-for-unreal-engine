# IDE gitignore for unreal engine 5

# NOTE: I HAVE MOSTLY RETIRED FROM UE WORK SO IM NOT UPDATING THIS MUCH BUT FEEL FREE TO FORK OR MESSAGE ME IF YOU WANNA ADD MORE

A custom gitignore i edit from time to time to account for all mainline IDEs i use/have used with unreal Engine in a similar fashion to how the default gitignore targets VS files. 

I designed this for myself but if you wanna use it yourself or add something i might have missed, thats totally fine.
